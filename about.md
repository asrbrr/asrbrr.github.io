Hi, my name is Asier. I work with Data, and with Wind Turbines, trying to make them more reliable and efficient.

This site is where I jot down notes or blog entries about topics that I like to keep track of. It is mostly about Data Science and related matters (books, python, R etc), but may contain other topics as well, such as Wind Energy

You can find me on, [twitter](https://twitter.com/asrbrr), [LinkedIn](https://es.linkedin.com/in/asierberra), or [email](mailto:asrbrr@gmail.com)

Thanks: this site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), hosted on [Github](https://github.com/asrbrr/asrbrr.github.io), and is mostly based on the theme [kactus](https://github.com/nickbalestra/kactus) by [nickbalestra](https://github.com/nickbalestra)
